potential objects/concepts:

score (possibly contained within lesson)
code fragment
lesson (contains code fragments, possibly holds scores)
lesson generator (creates lessons from text files containing code by making code fragments and determining which parts are comments)
codeType engine (main game logic)
interfaces: lesson chooser, fragment display, score display, lesson creator, pause


major parts:
GUI - direct input to engine, process results
CodeType Engine - processes input and determines appropriate progress, handles timing and calculates score
Code Fragment - container that holds code and distinguishes between comments/uneeded characters and code characters
